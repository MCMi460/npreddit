So basically I have this ancient laptop that is basically a family heirloom at this point

And since I don't have an actual laptop that I can program on during vacation, I'm landlocked to this thing for anything that I want to do when it comes to a keyboard

To be honest, I'm surprised it can even start up

Anyways, Reddit kept crashing this old thing, so I made a Firefox extension to load an older version of the website that's less resource-intensive

That's all. Thanks for reading, I guess. Why am I like this?

### oh frick

Yeah frick I forgot to mention that if you wanna use this, just do "about:debugging" in Firefox, click on "this Firefox" and load the manifest.json in this repo to load the extension. The code is literally one line, I'm not hacking you, gosh please shut up
